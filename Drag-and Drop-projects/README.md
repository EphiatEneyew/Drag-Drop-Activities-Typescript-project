where a project essentially we have lists of projects and we'll have two lists of projects.an active list and a finished list.and we'll be able to drag and drop items from one list to the other and stuff like that.

Webpack.then I have used it to get a a setup, a project setup, which gives us the best of all worlds, actually,where we can write code split up into multiple files without that disadvantage and which we'll have a look at now.

I organize the Drug-Drop-Project in 5 components:-
              -components---contain classes
              -decorator---contain decorators
              -models
              -utils--contain the validator concepts
              -state--- contain the class which manage the state of projects

              
To run the project first you  install Webpack :-
          npm install --save-dev Webpack webpack -cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader
